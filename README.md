# Computing Matrix $\varphi$-Functions Arising in Exponential Integrators

This repository contains the code used in the technical report:

A. H. Al-Mohy and X. Liu. [*Computing matrix Ï†-functions arising in exponential integrators*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01193). ArXiv:2506.01193 [math.NA], June 2025.

The code was tested in MATLAB 2024b. 

The main function `phi_funm.m` computes phi-functions of a matrix for given indices, and the script `simple_test.m` runs a simple test.
The directory `replication/` contains required subroutines for reproducing the results in the paper.


## Replicating the results

To reproduce the results in the paper, the following MATLAB toolboxes need to be installed:

- [Advanpix Multiprecision Computing Toolbox](https://www.advanpix.com)

- [Anymatrix](https://github.com/north-numerical-computing/anymatrix)

where in Anymatrix the test matrix collection

- [matrices-expm](https://github.com/xiaobo-liu/matrices-expm)

needs to be incorporated as a group.

The results presented in the manuscript can be generated by running:

```
>> test_main
```
